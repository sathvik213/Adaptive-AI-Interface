# Adaptive AI Trust Simulator  

This is a simple Streamlit application simulating how user trust in an AI visualization assistant calibrates over a fixed number of interaction turns.

The code simulates AI behavior using simple rule-based logic and probabilities for suggestions and adaptive error rates, rather than applying complex AI algorithms.

It demonstrates concepts such as:
- Shows how trust in AI adjusts based on its performance and mistakes.
- Explores how a user's expertise shapes their interaction with AI.

- Highlights AI adapting its behavior to match user trust levels.
- Demonstrates user engagement with AI in a visual analytics setting using Iris dataset.

## How to Run

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2.  Make sure you have Python installed.
3.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
4.  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application will open in your web browser.
